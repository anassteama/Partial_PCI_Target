* Memory read.
* Memory write.
* Memory read line.
* Memory read multiple.
* Parity generation.
* Parity error generation.
* 32 bit and 64 bits read and write transacation.
* Target has ability to terminate the transacation.

HDL directory has the Verilog source files.
Waveforms directory has wavefrom for most features.
